[x] In the photo **selection mode**, the user can long-press to enter selection, select/deselect multiple images, and then share them. However, when all photos are deselected, the app does not exit the selection mode, which creates confusion and an unnecessary extra step for the user.

[x] **Fix Refresh Issue:**
   The Admin page does not automatically refresh after adding, editing, or deleting photos. Enable real-time or on-action state updates to reflect changes instantly.

[ ] **Simplify WhatsApp Sharing Flow:**
   Reduce unnecessary steps and options when sharing photos via WhatsApp to make the process more streamlined and intuitive.

[ ] **Fabric Type Saving Issue:**
   When a new fabric type is added, it should automatically be saved and immediately appear in the fabric type dropdown without requiring a manual refresh.

[ ] **"Save & Next" Behavior in Bulk Photo Editing:**
   After clicking the **Save** button during bulk editing, the user should be automatically redirected to the **next photo** for editing. This will improve workflow speed and eliminate extra clicks.

[ ] **Replace Success Screen with Toast Notification:**
   Instead of showing a separate success screen after a bulk upload, display a **compact toast message**. This will reduce unnecessary user interaction and streamline the experience.

[ ] **Optimize Photo Loading Speed:**
   Improve the speed at which photos load, especially in the gallery view and admin view. Consider lazy loading or image compression if needed.

[ ] **Compact Photo Grid:** Add the 'compact photo grid layout' view option in the app, similar to the attached screenshot. Each photo thumbnail should appear smaller, allowing more images to be displayed on the screen at once. The goal is to enhance usability and scrolling efficiency, especially when browsing large collections of photos. Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior across mobile and desktop devices.
