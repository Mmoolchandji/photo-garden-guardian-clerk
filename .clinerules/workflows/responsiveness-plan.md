# Rules to follow when impelementing Mobile responsiveness
Our app needs to be *fully responsive* across mobile and desktop.

- Follow a *mobile-first* strategy: prioritize the layout for small screens, then adjust for larger screens.
- Use modern UI/UX best practices for responsive design. (For Tailwind CSS, use the standard breakpoints like sm, md, lg, xl – no custom breakpoints unless necessary.)
- Ensure every page (especially the dashboard and project detail pages) reflows properly on a small screen: elements should stack or resize as needed, text should remain readable, and no content should overflow off-screen.
- *Do not change the core design or functionality*, Just ensure the layout adapts responsively and cleanly to mobile screens without affecting the overall experience.
