### Principles for UX Enhancement

1. __User-Centric Design__: All improvements should directly address user needs, pain points, or enhance their interaction with the application.
2. __Improving the user experience (UX)__ without affecting core functionality or disrupting existing styling.
3. __Iterative Approach__: Implement changes in small, testable increments to allow for continuous feedback and adjustments.
4. __Performance Focus__: Ensure UX enhancements do not degrade application performance (e.g., loading times, responsiveness).
5. __Accessibility__: Strive for improvements that make the application more usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
6. __Consistency__: Maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction pattern across the application.
7. __Ask for uer Feedback__" After each iteration or proposed change, provide specific, ask for actionable feedback on whether the UX goal was met and if any unintended side effects occurred.
